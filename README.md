LemonTree (c) Fresh Model Versioning 
LieberLieber is proud to present a brand new Enterprise Architect tool named LemonTree (c). The most important function of this ground-breaking product is the diffing and merging of model versions.

Now, you do not have to lock your packages. Just check-in your eap files in your version control system such as Git, SVN, PTC or RTC!

Standard approaches use line- and text-based applications that do not suffice for graphic models. Only the finely-grained 3-way diffing algorithm that considers the modelâ€™s graph structure enables an exact comparison between two models. 
Highlights:

    Diff & Merge: Diffing and merging of Enterprise Architect models
    Model Versioning: Parallel editing of models with optimistic model versioning
    Integration: Seamless integration with Subversion (Tortoise) included
    Automation Interface: Automate LemonTree and integrate it in your versioning tool such as Git, PTC, or SVN
    Model Branches: Branches of models (longer-term, parallel development of versions and variants)
    Merge Preview: Diagram merge and merge preview
    Review: Changes are visualized clearly and understandably for review (including preview)
